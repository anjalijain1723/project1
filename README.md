Here are few small projects of data analysis done by me .
The first project is in the SQL form which is the analysis of the movies' imdb ratings.
I have carefully studied various movies ratings , reason of their fame or failure and the direction done .
The best performing actors and actresses are also analysed by me in the script .
the best imdb rated movies of particular years are also researched. 


The second project is done with the help of python and the analysis is done 
on the Uber trips . 
In the script ,I have used matplotlib and seaborn for the proper visualisation of the Uber pickups .
According to my analysis , if Uber collaborates with more TLC base companies in the areas with the most pickups ,
that would increase the profit margin by 4%.
I have shown the most pickups , the busiest areas , the lattitude and longitutdes of those areas and the no. of TLC base companies 
working in that area .
